In order to get a taste of and learn how to create Chrome Extensions, I followed this freeCodeCamp video ([Build a ChromeExtension - Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4)).

## Getting Started

In order to get started with the video:

1. Have the basic tools for HTML/CSS/JS development installed like `git`, `node` or `bun`, and a text editor (like Neovim, which I use by the way).

2. Clone the repo and cd into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raman-at-pieces/youtube-bookmarker-starter-code
cd youtube-bookmarker-starter-code
```

3. In your Chromium browser of choice (I recommend Google Chrome or Edge to reduce complication), open the browser extensions page and find a toggle for Developer Mode (toggle that on)

4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button and select the folder where you cloned the repo.

5. Follow along with the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4
